              To certify your character you may send an in-game message to a verification account. All it does is let
              the owner of the website know, that the character you registered actually exists. It is a scam protection.
              It is a recommended step also to help recover your shop if you clean your cache or use another device.

              You need to certify the same character once more, this will link your old shop to the new one and merge
              the content of both shops. If you use 2 devices, they should now be synced.
